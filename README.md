# What's Up Boiler Up Website

# WhatsUpBoilerUp.com

## Overview

This website takes data from https://boilerlink.purdue.edu/events and creates a map of Purdue University's campus with the locations of events within the current day/next few days. This project was created for the 2023 Hello World hackathon by Ashwath Singh, Aaruni Gupta, Ronald Tsai, and Atharva Kerkar.

Navigate the site by clicking and dragging the map around and clicking the markers to read more details about an event.

The languages/tools used are nodejs, HTML, CSS, leaflet, figma, openstreetmaps, geocode, google sheets, python, and json.

## Motivation

The boiler link website formatting is currently too bloated. it is difficult for users to read through the list of hundreds of events to find one that they want to attend. With What's Up Boiler Up, we make finding events easier.

## Challenges

We had severe difficulty making the node.js file compatible with browser HTML during the 24 hour time constraint of the hackathon. However, we found a way to scan the BoilerLink data from Vanilla JS itself using Fetch API. We also were sleep deprived as we stayed awake for the full 24 hours to work on the project.
